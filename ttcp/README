ttcp.c          Source that runs on IRIX 3.3.x and 4.0.x systems,
                BSD-based systems, and RTEMS.  This version also
                uses getopt(3) and has 2 new options: -f and -T.


How to get TCP performance numbers:

        receiver                                sender

host1%  ttcp -r -s                      host2% ttcp -t -s host1

-n and -l options change the number and size of the buffers.
