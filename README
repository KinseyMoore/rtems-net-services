Overview
--------

The rtems-net-services repository serves as a central location to manage
libraries and tests that require network support, but can otherwise be shared
across multiple network stacks.

File Origins
------------

The sources presented here originate in one of several locations described by
the ORIGIN.* files and whose license is described by the COPYING.* files.
Commits adding such files should include the hash of the target repository if
applicable.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
1. Populate the git submodules:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
2. Configure and build
```
./waf configure --prefix=INSTALL_PREFIX
./waf
./waf install
```

More `waf` arguments can be found by using:
`./waf --help`

Further Build Information
-------------------------

The BSPs configured to build may be specified on the waf configure command line
with --rtems-bsps or they may be configured in config.ini as in RTEMS. The
command line option will override the BSPs configured in config.ini.
